Subject: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Questions in the Labyrinth Game

After reading the description of Labyrinth, we have some concerns that require additional clarification.

Can players slide a tile that some other player are on? Can such slide remove a player from the board?

Are the treasures unique to all players?

Why does the initial spare tile holds a fake gem instead of a valid gem?
