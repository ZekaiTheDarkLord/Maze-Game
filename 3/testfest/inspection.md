NOTE: Your self eval is very poorly formatted.

Note:-

-20 Self eval is not accurate. These are bad links. You arent supposed to link to master/main but a specific commit instead.

-5  Updating a data class in insufficient, updates to the game state ought to be delegated through the game state interface.

-5  Check whether the active player's move has returned its avatar home
